LoPay is a **school fee installment payment platform** designed to enable parents to pay school fees flexibly while ensuring schools receive confirmed payments and the platform earns a fixed service fee.

This backend is engineered with **security, trust, and financial integrity** as first-class concerns.

## 💳 Financial Integrity & Payment Rules

### Fee Structure

1.  **Platform Fee:** **2.5% of the total school fee**. Fixed at enrollment.
2.  **School First Payment:** Minimum of **25% of the total school fee**.

### Minimum First Payment Formula

The system enforces a minimum deposit to ensure the platform fee is collected upfront:

> `minimumDeposit = (25% of school fee) + (2.5% platform fee)`

### Payment Lifecycle

All payments follow a strict status lifecycle controlled by backend logic:

> `PENDING` → `ACTIVE` → `COMPLETED` (or `DEFAULTED`)

1.  **Enrollment & First Payment:**
    - Parent selects school/class.
    - System calculates minimum payment.
    - Enrollment created with fee snapshots.
    - Status: `PENDING` until confirmed by School.
2.  **Installment Payments:**
    - Parent submits installment.
    - Status: `PENDING`.
    - School confirms payment → Balance updates.

## ⚙️ Configuration & Setup

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory. You **must** define the following variables for the application to start (validation is enforced):

```env
# Server Config
NODE_ENV=development  # development | production | test
PORT=3000

# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/lopay?schema=public"

# Authentication (Backend JWT)
JWT_SECRET="your-strong-jwt-secret-here"

# Firebase Admin SDK (Get these from Firebase Console > Project Settings > Service Accounts)
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL="firebase-adminsdk-xxxxx@your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n..."
```

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the app

```bash
# development
npm run start

# watch mode
npm run start:dev

# production mode
npm run start:prod
```

| **Database** | PostgreSQL |
| **Authentication** | Firebase Admin + JWT |
| **Architecture** | Modular (Domain-based) |

## 🔐 Security & Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization

- **Auth:** Firebase Admin verifies identity; JWT issued for API access.
- **JWT Payload:** `{ userId, role, schoolId? }`
- **Guards:** `JwtAuthGuard` (validates user), `RolesGuard` (enforces permissions).
- **Security Note:** User identity is derived strictly from `req.user`, never from the request body.

### Database Design Principles

- **Snapshots:** Financial data (fees) is snapshotted at enrollment.
- **Immutability:** Financial records are never mutated, only appended.
- **Audit:** Full history is preserved to prevent recalculation errors.
